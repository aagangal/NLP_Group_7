# NLP_Group_7
Final Project Group 7 for FA23: INTRO TO NLP

We are going to create a music recommendation engine wherein we take a song title as an input, and we use sentiment analysis to output similar songs. The problem we will solve is we are going to provide an efficient way to discover new music based on the userâ€™s music taste. User does not need to have any additional knowledge other than the song title to be provided similar music. Our target users are people who prefer simplicity, security, and efficiency when it comes to discovering new music. This differentiates us from other similar solutions that already exist in the market. We are utilizing an existing Kaggle dataset to develop and train our algorithm to be able to provide better song recommendations.
